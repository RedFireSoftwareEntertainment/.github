## About Us

*"****Trying to create quality FOSS solutions to the proprietary software of today****"*

Red Fire Software Entertainment is a group of passionate developers from Greece who create innovative and user-friendly software solutions for various platforms. Our main project is AZOS GNU/Linux, an operating system based on Arch Linux that is designed to be everything.

Our mission is to provide high-quality software that is free, open source, secure, and stable. We believe in the power of collaboration and community, and we welcome feedback and contributions from anyone who shares our vision and goals. We are always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as developers and as a team.

We are not a company and we want to make it clear that our goal is not money but making free software for the people. We are just a group of friends coming together to do something they are passionate about.

If you want to know more about us or our projects, please visit our website or contact us through our social media channels. We would love to hear from you and answer any questions you might have.
